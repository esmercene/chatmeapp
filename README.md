Install the Client Dependencies

Install the Server Dependencies

In the Server Directory there's a .env file (create one if none). Change the value of MONGODB_PASSWORD inside the file. Set the value as your own password.

Now start the server by npm start or yarn start.

Now start the react by npm start or yarn start.

The chat application would be running successfully by now.
